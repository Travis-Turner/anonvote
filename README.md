This simple app is built with NodeJS and uses MongoDB to store data.  It is
designed to be a reddit-like website, with registration, authorization and authentication features,
but all of the posts are anonymous.  It supports a comment feature on individual posts,
posts are ranked by their 'score'.  

It uses various packages available on NPM as dependencies including express, express-session, connect-flash,
bcrypt, mongoose, and body-parser.
